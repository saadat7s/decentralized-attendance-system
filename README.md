# Decentralized Attendance System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a decentralized attendance system using the Solana blockchain. The system will provide a transparent, secure, and tamper-proof method for recording and managing attendance records.

## Goals
- Implement a decentralized solution to track attendance.
- Ensure data integrity and security using blockchain technology.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing attendance.

## Features
- Decentralized storage of attendance records.
- Secure and tamper-proof data using Solana blockchain.
- Real-time updates and accessibility for all users.
- User authentication and role-based access control.

## Technologies Used
- **Solana**: Blockchain platform for decentralized applications.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Backend server for handling API requests.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user information and attendance logs.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the backend server.
- **Redux**: State management for React applications.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-attendance-system.git
    cd decentralized-attendance-system
    ```
2. Install dependencies for backend and frontend:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
3. Configure environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add necessary configurations.
4. Run the development servers:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

## Usage
1. Register as a new user or log in with existing credentials.
2. Access the dashboard to view and manage attendance records.
3. Admins can add or remove users and manage their roles.
4. Users can check their attendance records and submit requests.
